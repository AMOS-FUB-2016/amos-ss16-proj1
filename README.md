## Installing

### Using Eclipse

Use the gradle wrapper (or your local gradle installation) and execute the following task:

```
gradle eclipse
```

Then, in Eclipse, use `File -> Import ...`, select `Existing Projects into Workspace` and navigate to the project folder and press `Finish`.

Note: since the Buildship Gradle plugin for Eclipse does not support web projects, only the classic option using the Gradle `eclipse-wtp` is viable.

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

TBD
