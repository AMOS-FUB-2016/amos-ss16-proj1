This configuration will run a packaged web application (WAR) in a Docker environment configured with Tomcat and PostgreSQL.
The WAR file has to be placed in the web folder as "application.war".  The web app will be deployed to the ROOT context.
By default, Tomcat will be accessible from port 8081. The manager app is accessible from the /mgr resource.

To compose the system, run:

    docker-compose build

Then, to run/stop the environment, use:

    docker-compose up -d
    docker-compose stop

If you wish to open a shell in one of the containers, run

    docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash

A list of all container ids can be found using

    docker ps -a
